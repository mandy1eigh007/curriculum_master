# Curriculum Outline

This document organizes the curriculum components from the provided MENU file, which contains analyses of the 2024 Combined Curriculum Project and the 2022 ANEW P.A. Student Workbook. It serves as a baseline for redesigning the curriculum.

## Categories and Components

### Introduction to Pre-Apprenticeship

### Professional Development Principles (Intro / Midterm / Final)
- Intro: “Professional Development Principles – Part 1.”
- Midterm (closest match): “Self-Assessment and B.A.M.E’s integration into professional development planning.”
- Final: The document does not label a PDP “Final.” The closest “end-of-program” professional development requirements are tracked via early completion requirements (includes “Applied to Appre[...]”).
- Additional: “Professional Development Unit 12 “Leadership and long-term career planning.””

- Professional Development Unit 8 “Financial Tools for the Trades.”
- Modules: “Build Financial Control” and “Finding Our Heart and Brains” (Financial Literacy + Money Mindset).

### Emotional Intelligence
- Professional Development Unit 8 includes “Financial Tools,” but Emotional Intelligence is its own Professional Development Unit 8? (In the unit list it’s Unit 8 = Financial Tools; Emotional Intelligence appears as a separate unit? Wait, the document labels it as Unit 8 for Financial, but related content: “Conflict Resolution” module.

## 2022 ANEW P.A. Student Workbook Baseline

### Program Structure
- Total Course Hours: 280 hours, 35 days
- Additional required hours: 10 (Speed mentoring 2, Service learning 8)

### Dimensions and Hours
- D1 Professional Development: 34
- D2 ACES: 56
- D3 Career Exploration/Shop + Tours: 90
- D4 Math: 40
- D5 Safety Certs: 26
- D6 Physical Fitness: 34
- D7 Outside-hours: 10 (separate from the 280)

### Core Artifacts
- Student Handbook / policies: attendance, tardy/no-show rules, discipline ladder, reporting/rights
- “3P’s & W”: Punctuality, Perseverance/Commitment, Positive Attitude, Work Ethic
- The Dimension/Unit curriculum outline listings (D1 topic list; D2 station instruction + repeated circuits; D3 shop units + tours)

### Known Inconsistency
- Attendance section references a “12-week period” while the curriculum totals define 35 days / 280 hours.

## Recommendations for Tracking Changes
- Use Git-based docs-as-code for master copy.
- Publish to GitHub Pages for access.
- Generate PDFs automatically.
- Separate artwork into a private repo.

## Next Steps
- Redesign the curriculum based on this outline, excluding old artwork.
- Create MkDocs structure for the new curriculum.
