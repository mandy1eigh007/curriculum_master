# Grit & Growth Mindset - Instructor Guide

## Module Overview

**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Format**: Interactive discussion and reflection  
**Class Size**: Works for groups of 5-30 students

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand the difference between fixed and growth mindset
- Recognize how grit contributes to long-term success
- Apply growth mindset language to their own learning challenges
- Develop strategies for building resilience in coding

## Session Structure

### Introduction (10 minutes)

**Opening Activity**: "The Power of Yet"

1. Ask students to write down one thing they struggle with in coding (anonymously on sticky notes or in chat)
2. Collect and read a few examples
3. For each example, add the word "yet" to reframe the statement
4. Explain: "Today we're learning about how our mindset affects our ability to learn and grow"

**Key Message**: Your abilities are not fixed. The brain can grow and change with effort and practice.

### Core Teaching (25 minutes)

#### Part 1: Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset (10 minutes)

**Lecture Points**:
- Define fixed mindset: belief that abilities are unchangeable
- Define growth mindset: belief that abilities can be developed
- Share the neuroscience: brain plasticity and how learning creates new neural pathways

**Interactive Element**:
- Present scenarios and ask students to identify fixed vs. growth mindset responses
- Example: "I got an error I don't understand"
  - Fixed: "I'm not smart enough to figure this out"
  - Growth: "I need to break this down and research the error message"

**Discussion Question**: "Can you think of a time when you shifted from a fixed to a growth mindset? What changed?"

#### Part 2: Understanding Grit (8 minutes)

**Lecture Points**:
- Define grit: passion + perseverance over the long term
- Explain why grit matters in software development
- Share example: Most successful developers spent years learning, failing, and persisting

**Story to Share**: Briefly describe a well-known developer or technologist who faced significant obstacles but persisted (e.g., early failures, rejection, technical challenges they overcame through persistence).

**Key Point**: Talent matters less than effort and persistence. Someone with less initial aptitude but more grit will outperform someone with natural talent who gives up easily.

#### Part 3: Applying Growth Mindset to Coding (7 minutes)

**Practical Strategies**:

1. **When stuck on a problem**:
   - Take a break and return with fresh eyes
   - Break the problem into smaller pieces
   - Explain the problem out loud (rubber duck debugging)
   - Ask for help strategically

2. **When receiving feedback**:
   - Separate the work from your self-worth
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Thank the person and apply the feedback

3. **When comparing to others**:
   - Remember everyone's learning journey is different
   - Focus on your own progress
   - Learn from others rather than competing

**Activity**: Think-Pair-Share
- Individual: "What coding challenge are you facing right now?"
- Pairs: Share with a partner and brainstorm growth mindset approaches
- Share: Invite 2-3 pairs to share with the class

### Reflection and Application (20 minutes)

#### Small Group Discussion (12 minutes)

Divide students into groups of 3-4. Assign each group one of the following discussion topics:

1. **The Role of Failure**: "Share a time you failed at something and what you learned. How did that failure help you grow?"

2. **Overcoming Challenges**: "What's the hardest thing you've had to learn (in coding or life)? What kept you going?"

3. **Mindset Shifts**: "What are some fixed mindset thoughts you've had about learning to code? How can you reframe them?"

4. **Building Resilience**: "What strategies help you bounce back when you're frustrated or stuck?"

Have groups report out key insights (2-3 minutes total).

#### Individual Reflection (5 minutes)

Ask students to write down answers to these questions:

1. What is one fixed mindset thought you want to change?
2. What is one growth mindset strategy you will try this week?
3. How will you remind yourself to practice a growth mindset?

#### Closing (3 minutes)

**Key Takeaways**:
- Your brain is like a muscle—it grows stronger with practice and challenge
- Struggle and mistakes are essential parts of learning
- The word "yet" is powerful: "I can't do this… yet"
- Grit—sustained effort over time—is a better predictor of success than talent

**Call to Action**: "This week, notice your self-talk when you face a challenge. Practice reframing fixed mindset thoughts into growth mindset thoughts."

## Teaching Tips

### Creating a Safe Environment

- Normalize struggle: Share your own coding frustrations and how you overcame them
- Celebrate effort, not just results: Praise students who tried hard, asked good questions, or learned from mistakes
- Model growth mindset language: Use phrases like "I don't know yet" or "Let's figure this out together"

### Differentiation

**For students who grasp concepts quickly**:
- Challenge them to help others (teaching reinforces learning)
- Ask them to reflect on times they struggled and how they persevered
- Encourage them to tackle more complex problems outside their comfort zone

**For students who are struggling**:
- Emphasize that struggling means their brain is growing
- Break down the session into smaller chunks with more check-ins
- Provide concrete, specific strategies they can apply immediately

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't imply "just think positively"**: Growth mindset is not about empty optimism. It's about recognizing that effort and strategy lead to improvement.

2. **Don't dismiss real obstacles**: Some students face significant barriers (learning disabilities, lack of resources, systemic inequities). Acknowledge these while still empowering students to control what they can.

3. **Don't over-praise**: Praising effort alone isn't enough if strategies are ineffective. Combine praise with specific feedback on what's working and what to adjust.

## Assessment

This module does not require formal grading. However, you can assess engagement through:

- Participation in discussions and activities
- Quality of reflection responses
- Application of growth mindset language in future sessions

## Follow-Up

In subsequent coding sessions, reinforce growth mindset:

- When students say "I can't," prompt them to add "yet"
- Celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities
- Share your own debugging struggles and problem-solving processes
- Regularly ask: "What did you learn from this mistake?"

- "Teaching a Growth Mindset" (various educational journals)

## Troubleshooting

**"What if students are skeptical about growth mindset?"**
- Acknowledge their skepticism as valid
- Present the neuroscience evidence
- Share concrete examples of people (including yourself) who improved significantly through effort
- Invite them to experiment for a week and see what happens

**"What if the discussion gets too personal or emotional?"**
- Thank students for sharing
- Remind the group of confidentiality and respect
- If needed, redirect to coding-specific examples
- Follow up individually with students who seem distressed

**"What if we're running short on time?"**
- Prioritize the core teaching (Part 1 and Part 2)
- Shorten the small group discussion to 5 minutes
- Make the individual reflection a take-home activity

**"How do I handle students who say they're 'just not good at coding'?"**
- Validate their current feelings without agreeing with the fixed mindset
- Ask: "What makes you think that? What evidence do you have?"
- Share: "Many successful developers felt that way at first. What changed was their approach and persistence."
- Provide a concrete next step: "What's one small thing you could practice this week?"

## Customization Notes

- **For shorter sessions (30-45 min)**: Skip the small group discussions or make them whole-class discussions
- **For longer sessions (90 min)**: Add a hands-on activity where students tackle a challenging coding problem and reflect on their mindset throughout
- **For remote learning**: Use breakout rooms for small groups; use a shared document for individual reflections
- **For advanced students**: Focus more on grit and long-term goal setting; discuss how to maintain passion during plateaus

## Connection to Other Modules

This module lays the foundation for:

- **Debugging and Problem Solving**: Approaching errors with curiosity rather than frustration
- **Collaboration**: Being open to feedback and learning from peers
- **Project Work**: Persisting through challenges in longer-term projects
- **Career Development**: Building resilience for job searches and workplace challenges

Refer back to growth mindset concepts throughout the program to reinforce the learning.
