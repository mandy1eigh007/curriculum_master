# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Required Hours
- **Total Hours**: 60 minutes
- **Session Pattern**: 1 session of 60 minutes

## Why this matters in construction
Construction is a skill trade. Skills are built through reps, feedback, and time under instruction. People who succeed are not the ones who never struggle. They are the ones who respond to struggle with a plan.

This session is about how to stay in the fight when:
- a task feels too hard
- you get corrected by an instructor or jobsite leader
- you make a mistake
- you feel behind compared to others

## Learning goals
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Explain the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset in jobsite terms
- Use a simple reset script after mistakes or feedback
- Build a short practice plan for one skill you need to improve

## Key terms
Fixed mindset  
Belief that ability is permanent: "I'm just bad at this."

Growth mindset  
Belief that ability can improve with training: "I'm not good at this yet."

Grit  
Staying consistent over time, especially when progress feels slow.

Deliberate practice  
Targeted practice with feedback and correction (not just repeating the same mistake).

## What growth mindset looks like on a job site
Growth mindset does not mean "being positive." It means being coachable and organized when you are learning.

Examples:
- Measuring: "I keep misreading the tape. I'm going to slow down, call out the marks, and check my partner."
- Power tools: "My cut line is wandering. I'm going to practice setup, stance, and trigger control with scrap first."
- Physical tasks: "My pace drops on the second round. I'm going to adjust breathing and posture and ask for a form check."
- Communication: "I froze when I got corrected. Next time I'm going to say 'Copy' and ask one clarifying question."

## The feedback rule
In construction, feedback is normal. It is not a personal attack. It is a correction so the work is safe, accurate, and on schedule.

When you get corrected, the goal is to:
1) Acknowledge it
2) Apply it
3) Confirm the expectation

A simple script:
- "Copy."
- "You want it like this, correct?"
- "I'll fix it now."

## Mistakes are data
Mistakes tell you what skill needs practice.
Common learning mistakes in pre-apprenticeship:
- rushing setup
- skipping measurement checks
- not asking questions early
- changing your method without understanding why
- letting embarrassment delay correction

## Practice plan (10 minutes)
Pick one skill you want to improve this week (examples: tape measure reading, speed square layout, ladder setup, tool handling, ACE station pacing).

Write your plan using this format:
- Skill:
- What "good" looks like:
- My current issue:
- One change I will make:
- How I will practice (reps and where):
- How I will get feedback:
- How I will track improvement:

## Close
You are not being graded on being perfect. You are being graded on being safe, coachable, and consistent. Construction rewards people who show up, learn, and adjust.
