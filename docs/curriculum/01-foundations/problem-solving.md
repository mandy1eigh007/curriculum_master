# Problem Solving Basics

## Required Hours
- **Total Hours**: 20 hours
- **Session Pattern**: 5 sessions of 4 hours each

## Purpose

Problem solving is at the heart of software development. This module teaches structured approaches to breaking down complex challenges, designing solutions, and implementing them effectively. These skills apply to every aspect of programming and professional development.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Apply systematic problem-solving frameworks to coding challenges
- Break complex problems into manageable components
- Design algorithms using pseudocode and flowcharts
- Evaluate multiple solutions and choose appropriate approaches
- Debug systematically when solutions don't work as expected
- Communicate problem-solving approaches clearly to others

## Core Content

### The Problem-Solving Process

Effective problem solving follows a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read carefully, identify inputs and outputs, clarify requirements
2. **Plan the Solution**: Break down into steps, consider edge cases, choose approach
3. **Implement**: Write code following the plan
4. **Test**: Verify solution works for various inputs
5. **Refine**: Optimize and improve based on testing

### Decomposition

Breaking problems into smaller, more manageable pieces:

- Identify major components or steps
- Define clear boundaries between parts
- Solve each part independently
- Combine solutions into complete answer
- Recognize common patterns across problems

### Pattern Recognition

Identifying similarities helps apply known solutions to new problems:

- Recognize problem types (searching, sorting, counting, etc.)
- Apply established patterns and algorithms
- Adapt existing solutions to new contexts
- Build a mental library of solution patterns

### Abstraction

Focus on essential details while ignoring irrelevant information:

- Identify what matters for the problem at hand
- Create generalizable solutions
- Use appropriate level of detail
- Model real-world problems in code

### Algorithm Design

Creating step-by-step solutions:

- Write pseudocode before coding
- Use flowcharts to visualize logic
- Consider alternative approaches
- Analyze efficiency and correctness
- Document assumptions and limitations

### Testing Strategies

Ensuring solutions work correctly:

- Test with simple cases first
- Try edge cases and boundary conditions
- Use representative sample data
- Verify expected outputs match actual outputs
- Test incrementally as you build

### Common Problem-Solving Patterns

Frequently encountered approaches:

- **Brute Force**: Try all possibilities
- **Divide and Conquer**: Split into subproblems
- **Greedy**: Make locally optimal choices
- **Backtracking**: Try options, undo if needed
- **Dynamic Programming**: Build on previous solutions

### Debugging as Problem Solving

When code doesn't work:

- Reproduce the error consistently
- Form hypotheses about the cause
- Test each hypothesis systematically
- Isolate the problematic code
- Fix and verify the solution

## Deliverables

- Solved coding challenges demonstrating problem decomposition
- Pseudocode and flowcharts for complex algorithms
- Documentation of problem-solving process and decisions
- Portfolio of problems solved with multiple approaches
- Peer teaching exercise explaining a solution approach
