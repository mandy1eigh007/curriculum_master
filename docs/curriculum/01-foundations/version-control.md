# Version Control and Collaboration

## Required Hours
- **Total Hours**: 20 hours
- **Session Pattern**: 5 sessions of 4 hours each

## Purpose

Version control is essential for professional software development, enabling teams to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain code history. This module teaches Git, the industry-standard version control system, and collaborative workflows using platforms like GitHub.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Understand version control concepts and why they matter
- Use Git to track changes in their code
- Create and manage branches for feature development
- Merge code changes and resolve conflicts
- Collaborate with others using pull requests
- Navigate and contribute to open-source projects

## Core Content

### Why Version Control Matters

Version control systems track every change made to files over time. This provides:

- Complete history of all changes
- Ability to revert to previous versions
- Safe experimentation through branching
- Effective collaboration among team members
- Backup and recovery capabilities

### Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system. Core concepts include:

- Repository: Project folder tracked by Git
- Commit: Snapshot of changes with a message
- Branch: Independent line of development
- Remote: Version of repository on a server
- Clone: Local copy of a remote repository

### Essential Git Commands

Fundamental Git operations:

```
git init          # Initialize new repository
git clone         # Copy remote repository
git add          # Stage changes for commit
git commit       # Save staged changes
git status       # Check repository state
git log          # View commit history
git push         # Upload commits to remote
git pull         # Download changes from remote
```

### Branching and Merging

Branches allow parallel development without affecting the main codebase:

- Creating branches for new features
- Switching between branches
- Merging completed work back to main
- Resolving merge conflicts when they occur

### Collaborative Workflows

Professional teams use structured workflows:

- Feature branch workflow: Each feature gets its own branch
- Pull requests: Propose changes for review
- Code review: Team members review before merging
- Protected branches: Main branch requires approval
- Continuous integration: Automated testing on changes

### GitHub Platform

GitHub adds collaboration features to Git:

- Remote repository hosting
- Pull request system for code review
- Issue tracking for bugs and features
- Project boards for organization
- Actions for automation
- Pages for documentation hosting

### Best Practices

Effective version control practices:

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit related changes together
- Pull before pushing to stay synchronized
- Review changes before committing
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use branches for all new work

## Deliverables

- Git repository with complete commit history
- Branching and merging exercises completed successfully
- Pull request submitted with code review participation
- Contribution to a collaborative team project
- Documentation of workflow and best practices learned
