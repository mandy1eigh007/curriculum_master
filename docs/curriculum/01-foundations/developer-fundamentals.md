## Core Content

### Introduction to Software Development

Software development is both an art and a science. Developers create solutions to real-world problems by writing code that computers can execute. Understanding the development process, from requirements gathering to deployment, helps developers work efficiently and deliver quality software.

### Computational Thinking

Computational thinking involves breaking down complex problems into manageable parts. Key aspects include:

- Decomposition: Breaking problems into smaller sub-problems
- Pattern recognition: Identifying similarities and trends
- Abstraction: Focusing on important information while ignoring irrelevant details
- Algorithm design: Creating step-by-step solutions

### Development Environment Setup

Professional developers use various tools to write, test, and debug code. Setting up an effective development environment includes:

- Installing and configuring code editors or IDEs
- Understanding file systems and directory structures
- Using command-line interfaces effectively
- Managing system paths and environment variables

### Code Quality and Best Practices

Writing code that others can understand and maintain is crucial. Best practices include:

- Using meaningful variable and function names
- Writing clear comments when necessary
- Following consistent formatting and style
- Keeping functions small and focused
- Avoiding code duplication

### Debugging Fundamentals

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code. Effective debugging strategies include:

- Reading and understanding error messages
- Using print statements strategically
- Employing debugger tools
- Testing hypotheses systematically
- Rubber duck debugging

### Professional Collaboration

Software development is often a team effort. Professional collaboration skills include:

- Communicating technical concepts clearly
- Participating in code reviews constructively
- Writing documentation for teammates
- Using issue tracking systems
- Following team coding standards

## Deliverables

- Development environment successfully configured and tested
- Completed exercises demonstrating computational thinking
- Portfolio of code samples following best practices
- Debugging journal documenting problem-solving approaches
- Collaborative project contribution with peer review
