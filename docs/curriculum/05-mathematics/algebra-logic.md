## Core Content

### Algebraic Thinking in Programming

Algebra provides tools for representing and manipulating abstract concepts. In programming, algebraic thinking helps with:

- Variables and expressions
- Solving for unknowns
- Understanding function behavior
- Manipulating formulas in code

### Boolean Logic

Boolean logic is the foundation of computer decision-making:

- True and false values
- AND, OR, and NOT operations
- Combining conditions with logical operators
- Short-circuit evaluation
- De Morgan's laws for simplification

### Truth Tables

Truth tables systematically show all possible outcomes of logical expressions:

```
A     B     A AND B     A OR B     NOT A
T     T        T          T          F
T     F        F          T          F
F     T        F          T          T
F     F        F          F          T
```

### Conditional Logic

Using logic to control program flow:

- If-then statements
- If-then-else branches
- Nested conditionals
- Multiple conditions with logical operators
- Switch/case statements

### Mathematical Operations

Fundamental operations used in programming:

- Arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Order of operations
- Integer vs. floating-point division
- Modulo operation for remainders
- Exponentiation

### Expressions and Equations

Translating between mathematical notation and code:

- Evaluating expressions
- Operator precedence
- Parentheses for grouping
- Assignment vs. equality
- Compound assignment operators

### Problem-Solving Strategies
