## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics
- Understand probability concepts and their applications in programming
- Apply statistical thinking to analyze data and make decisions
- Use random processes appropriately in programs
- Understand uncertainty and variability in software systems

## Core Content

### Descriptive Statistics

Summarizing and describing data:

**Measures of Central Tendency**:
- Mean (average): Sum divided by count
- Median: Middle value when sorted
- Mode: Most frequent value
- When to use each measure

**Measures of Spread**:
- Range: Difference between max and min
- Variance: Average squared deviation from mean
- Standard deviation: Square root of variance
- Quartiles and interquartile range

**Data Visualization**:
- Histograms for distributions
- Box plots for comparing groups
- Scatter plots for relationships
- Choosing appropriate visualizations

### Probability Fundamentals

Understanding likelihood and chance:

**Basic Probability**:
- Probability as ratio: favorable outcomes / total outcomes
- Range: 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)
- Complement: P(not A) = 1 - P(A)
- Independent vs dependent events

**Combining Probabilities**:
- Addition rule: P(A or B) for mutually exclusive events
- Multiplication rule: P(A and B) for independent events
- Conditional probability: P(A given B)
- Common probability mistakes

### Random Numbers in Programming

Generating and using randomness:

- **Pseudorandom Number Generators**: How they work
- **Uniform Distribution**: Equal probability for all values
- **Random Sampling**: Selecting random elements
- **Seeding**: Reproducible randomness for testing
- **Applications**: Simulations, games, testing, security

### Distributions

Common patterns in data:

**Discrete Distributions**:
- Uniform: Equal probability
- Binomial: Success/failure trials
- Poisson: Events over time/space

**Continuous Distributions**:
- Normal (bell curve): Most common in nature
- Properties of normal distribution
- Standard normal and z-scores
- Central Limit Theorem (concept)

### Statistical Analysis in Programming

Practical applications:

**Data Analysis**:
- Loading and cleaning data
- Computing summary statistics
- Identifying outliers and anomalies
- Making data-driven decisions

**A/B Testing**:
- Comparing two versions
- Statistical significance
- Sample size considerations
- Drawing valid conclusions

**Algorithm Analysis**:
- Average-case vs worst-case performance
- Expected running time
- Probabilistic algorithms
- Monte Carlo methods

### Correlation and Relationships

Understanding how variables relate:

- **Correlation**: Strength and direction of relationship
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Measuring linear relationships
- **Causation vs Correlation**: A does not imply B causes A
- **Regression (Introduction)**: Predicting from relationships

### Uncertainty and Error

Dealing with imperfect information:

- **Measurement Error**: Precision and accuracy
- **Uncertainty Propagation**: How errors compound
- **Confidence Intervals**: Range of likely values
- **Statistical Thinking**: Making decisions with incomplete data

### Practical Applications

Real-world uses in programming:

- **Testing**: Random test generation, property-based testing
