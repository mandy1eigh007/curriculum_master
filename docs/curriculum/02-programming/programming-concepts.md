# Programming Concepts

## Required Hours
- **Total Hours**: 30 hours
- **Session Pattern**: 8 sessions of 4 hours, with guided practice

## Purpose

Programming concepts form the universal building blocks used across all programming languages. Understanding these fundamentals enables students to learn any programming language and write effective, maintainable code regardless of the technology stack.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Understand and apply fundamental programming constructs
- Work with variables, data types, and operators effectively
- Implement control flow using conditionals and loops
- Create and use functions to organize code
- Understand scope and variable lifetime
- Apply programming concepts to solve real problems

## Core Content

### Variables and Data Types

Variables store information that programs need to remember and manipulate:

- **Primitive Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans
- **Type Systems**: Static vs dynamic typing
- **Type Conversion**: Implicit and explicit casting
- **Naming Conventions**: Clear, descriptive variable names
- **Constants**: Values that shouldn't change

### Operators

Operations performed on data:

- **Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo
- **Comparison**: Equal, not equal, greater than, less than
- **Logical**: AND, OR, NOT
- **Assignment**: Setting and updating values
- **Operator Precedence**: Order of operations

### Control Flow

Directing program execution:

**Conditional Statements**:
- If statements for decision making
- Else and else-if for multiple conditions
- Switch/case for multiple discrete options
- Ternary operators for simple conditions

**Loops**:
- While loops for unknown iterations
- For loops for known iterations
- Do-while for at least one execution
- Loop control: break and continue
- Nested loops for multi-dimensional problems

### Functions

Organizing code into reusable blocks:

- **Function Definition**: Creating named code blocks
- **Parameters**: Input to functions
- **Return Values**: Output from functions
- **Function Calls**: Using functions in code
- **Default Parameters**: Optional arguments
- **Recursion**: Functions calling themselves

### Scope and Lifetime

Understanding variable visibility and persistence:

- **Global Scope**: Available throughout program
- **Local Scope**: Available only within function or block
- **Block Scope**: Limited to control structures
- **Variable Shadowing**: Same names in different scopes
- **Lifetime**: When variables are created and destroyed

### Input and Output

Interacting with users and systems:

- **Standard Input**: Reading user input
- **Standard Output**: Displaying information
- **Formatting**: Controlling output appearance
- **Error Handling**: Dealing with invalid input
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files

### Collections Basics

Grouping related data:

- **Arrays/Lists**: Ordered collections
- **Indexing**: Accessing elements by position
- **Iteration**: Processing each element
- **Common Operations**: Add, remove, search, sort
- **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Tables and matrices

### Error Handling

Managing problems gracefully:

- **Exceptions**: Handling runtime errors
- **Try-Catch**: Catching and responding to errors
- **Error Messages**: Clear communication of problems
- **Validation**: Preventing errors before they occur
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing errors

## Deliverables

- Programs demonstrating each core concept
- Function library solving common problems
- Code with proper error handling and validation
- Refactored code showing improved organization
- Documentation explaining code logic and decisions
