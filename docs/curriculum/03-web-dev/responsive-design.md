## Required Hours
- **Total Hours**: 15 hours
- **Session Pattern**: 4 sessions of 4 hours

## Purpose

Responsive design ensures websites work well on devices of all sizes, from smartphones to large desktop monitors. This module teaches techniques for creating flexible, adaptive layouts that provide optimal user experiences across the full range of devices and screen sizes.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Apply mobile-first design principles
- Use media queries effectively
- Implement flexible grid systems
- Optimize images and media for different devices
- Test responsive designs across multiple viewports

## Core Content

### Mobile-First Design

Starting with the smallest screens:

**Why Mobile-First**:
- Mobile traffic dominates web usage
- Forces focus on essential content
- Easier to enhance than to reduce
- Better performance on mobile devices

**Mobile-First CSS**:
- Base styles for mobile
- Progressive enhancement with media queries
- Adding complexity for larger screens
- Avoiding mobile-specific overrides

### Media Queries

Conditional CSS for different contexts:

**Breakpoint Strategy**:
- Common breakpoints: 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Content-based breakpoints
- Major vs minor breakpoints
- Avoiding device-specific breakpoints

**Media Query Syntax**:
- min-width and max-width
- Combining conditions with and
- Orientation: portrait vs landscape
- Resolution and pixel density
- Print stylesheets

### Flexible Layouts

Creating adaptable structures:

**Fluid Grids**:
- Percentage-based widths
- Flexible containers
- Column systems
- Maintaining proportions

**Flexbox for Responsive Design**:
- Flex-wrap for multiple rows
- Changing flex-direction at breakpoints
- Flex-basis for proportional sizing
- Order property for visual reordering

**CSS Grid for Responsive Design**:
- Grid template areas changing at breakpoints
- Auto-fit and auto-fill
- Minmax for flexible track sizing
- Responsive gaps and spacing

### Responsive Typography

Text that scales appropriately:

**Relative Units**:
- rem for consistent scaling
- em for component-relative sizing
- Viewport units: vw, vh
- calc() for complex calculations

**Font Scaling**:
- Base font size strategy
- Headings and body text ratios
- Line height and readability
- Preventing text from being too small or large

### Responsive Images

Optimizing visual content:

**Image Techniques**:
- max-width: 100% for fluid images
- srcset for different resolutions
- picture element for art direction
- Lazy loading for performance
- WebP and modern formats

**Background Images**:
- Different images at different breakpoints
- Image-set for resolution switching
- Cover, contain, and other sizing
- Performance considerations

### Navigation Patterns

Adapting menus for different screens:

**Mobile Navigation**:
- Hamburger menu pattern
- Off-canvas navigation
- Bottom navigation bars
- Accordion menus

**Desktop Navigation**:
- Horizontal menu bars
- Dropdown menus
- Mega menus for complex sites
- Transitioning between patterns

### Testing and Debugging

Ensuring responsive designs work:

**Browser DevTools**:
- Responsive design mode
- Device emulation
- Testing at specific dimensions
- Simulating touch events
- Network throttling

**Real Device Testing**:
- Testing on actual devices
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance on mobile networks
- Touch interaction verification

### Performance Optimization

Fast loading on all devices:

**Mobile Performance**:
- Minimizing HTTP requests
- Compressing and minifying assets
- Critical CSS and above-the-fold content
- Deferring non-critical resources
- Image optimization and lazy loading

## Deliverables

- Fully responsive multi-page website
- Navigation working seamlessly on all screen sizes
- Optimized images adapting to device capabilities
- Typography scaling appropriately across breakpoints
- Documentation of breakpoint decisions and testing results
